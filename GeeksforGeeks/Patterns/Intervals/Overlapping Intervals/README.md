### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array of intervals  **arr[][]** of size n, where  **arr[i]**  =  **[starti, endi]**  represents the start and end points of the ith interval, merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting array of non-overlapping intervals.
 **Note:** Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] such that a ≤ c, are considered overlapping if  c ≤ b.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[][] = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]]
Output: [[1, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]]
Explanation: In the given intervals we have only two overlapping intervals here, [1, 3] and [2, 4] which on merging will become [1, 4]. Therefore we will return [[1, 4], [6, 8], [9, 10]].

```

```
Input: arr[][] = [[6, 8], [1, 9], [2, 4], [4, 7]]
Output: [[1, 9]]
Explanation: In the given intervals all the intervals overlap with the interval [1, 9]. Therefore we will return [1, 9].

```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ starti ≤ endi ≤ 106
